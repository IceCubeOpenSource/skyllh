This file contains a log-book for major changes between releases.

v23.2.0
=======
- Complete overhaul of SkyLLH for more generic handling of parameters
  (fixed & fit parameters) and their mapping to sources.

    - Single class core.parameters.Parameter for fixed and fit parameters.
    - New class core.parameters.ParameterModelMapper to map global parameters
      to local model (e.g. source) parameters.
    - Class method core.pdf.PDF.get_pd takes structured numpy.ndarray as
      argument, holding local parameter names and values for each source.

- Intrinsic support for multiple sources.

    - New class property core.trialdata.TrialDataManager.src_evt_idxs with
      source and event indices mapping selected events to the sources.

- Simplification of the class hierarchy & source code structure.

    - The source_model and flux_model modules of the skyllh.physics module have
      been moved to the skyllh.core module.

- Local configuration for an analysis.

    - The global configuration dictionary skyllh.core.config.CFG has been
      replaced by a local skyllh.core.config.Config instance, which is passed to
      an Analysis instance and all other class instances that need access to the
      configuration. Classes derived from skyllh.core.config.HasConfig provide
      the cfg property and require the cfg argument in their constructor.

- New generic flux model function concept.
- New generic PDF class for time PDFs.
- Support for Parquet data files via optional pyarrow Python package.
- Introduce factory concept for detector signal yield construction.

    DetSigYieldBuilder classes can provide a factory function to construct
    DetSigYield instances efficiently for multiple flux models.

- Speed improvements for analysis creation and trial generation.

    - i3.detsigyield.SingleParamFluxPointLikeSourceI3DetSigYieldBuilder:

        MC events are sorted in sin(true_dec) before histograms are made for
        each parameter value. Thus, numpy.histogram works faster.

    - core.event_selection.SpatialBoxEventSelectionMethod:

        Improved calculation of right-ascention difference. Thus, speed-up in
        trial generation when using this event selection method.

- core.scrambling.DataScrambler.scramble_data method also takes Dataset instance
  as argument
- Usage of the tqdm Python package for progress bars.
- More unit tests.
- Improved documentation.
- Following PEP8 coding style standard.
