This file contains a log-book for major changes between releases.

v23.2.0
=======
- Complete overhaul of SkyLLH for more generic handling of parameters
  (fixed & fit parameters) and their mapping to sources.

    - Single class core.parameters.Parameter for fixed and fit parameters.
    - New class core.parameters.ParameterModelMapper to map global parameters
      to local model (e.g. source) parameters.
    - Class method core.pdf.PDF.get_pd takes structured numpy.ndarray as
      argument, holding local parameter names and values for each source.

- Intrinsic support for multiple sources.

    - New class property core.trialdata.TrialDataManager.src_evt_idxs with
      source and event indices mapping selected events to the sources.

- Simplification of the class hierarchy & source code structure.
- New generic flux model function concept.
- New generic PDF class for time PDFs.
- Support for Parquet data files via optional pyarrow Python package.
- Introduce factory concept for detector signal yield construction.

    DetSigYieldBuilder classes can provide a factory function to construct
    DetSigYield instances efficiently for multiple flux models.

- Speed improvements for analysis creation and trial generation.

    - i3.detsigyield.SingleParamFluxPointLikeSourceI3DetSigYieldBuilder:

        MC events are sorted in sin(true_dec) before histograms are made for
        each parameter value. Thus, numpy.histogram works faster.

    - core.event_selection.SpatialBoxEventSelectionMethod:

        Improved calculation of right-ascention difference. Thus, speed-up in
        trial generation when using this event selection method.

- core.scrambling.DataScrambler.scramble_data method also takes Dataset instance
  as argument
- Usage of the tqdm Python package for progress bars.
- More unit tests.
- Improved documentation.
- Following PEP8 coding style standard.
